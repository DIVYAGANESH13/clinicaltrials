# clinicaltrials
Pharma trials face delays due to slow patient recruitment and manual adherence tracking, risking cost and data quality. Our solution is a central dashboard that integrates multi-site data, visualizes recruitment funnels, tracks adherence, compares site performance, and predicts dropout risk using AI.

## Problem Statement
Pharmaceutical companies face delays and high costs when clinical trials:
- Fail to recruit patients on schedule.
- Struggle to monitor patient adherence across multiple sites.
- Risk data quality issues due to manual monitoring.

**Solution**
We are building a **Central Command Center Dashboard** to:
1. Integrate trial data from EDC/EMR systems.
2. Visualize recruitment funnel (Screened ‚Üí Enrolled ‚Üí Randomized).
3. Show site performance leaderboard.
4. Track patient adherence (visits, medication).
5. Predict dropout risk using ML models.
